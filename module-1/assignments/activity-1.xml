  <definition>Hello, this is my introduction. </definition>​
  <background>I am from Turkey, married with a 5 year old son and extensive private and public sector 
  experience in Business administration. I am in my early thirties (33 to be specific), relatively older than my peers and with no previous 
  history in this field. What got me hooked with programming though, is my falling in love with Python and deciding that 
  I deeply enjoy creating scripts and programs from scratch.</background>
