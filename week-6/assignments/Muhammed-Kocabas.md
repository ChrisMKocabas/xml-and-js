-After my team members passed me the HTML, XSD and XML files for finalizing the project, I have went into HTML file and added the whole form.

-Also refactored XSD to eliminate a minor bug.

-Then I have created the javascript file and took care of all filtering functions.

-Finally I have created the CSS file and gave the form its currenct style.
