I did the following for my project:

1-I have created the a mock json data file using https://mockaroo.com/ My json file has 15 columns and 1000 rows as well as 4 different field types.

2-I have created my api with getAll and getById functions.

3-While implementing my html, I wanted it to look realistic and used a correctional services theme. I had also designed my data file with this theme in mind. My table has headers and multiple filters including a general input field, an ID only input field and 5 radio buttons pairs capable of filtering by string and boolan. It is also dynamically loading data from controller into this table.

4-I have installe npm and browserify, then bundled everything together.

Then I basically deployed my project to netlify and it is working perfectly. Finally.
